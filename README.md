JuPylates is an exerciser engine for learning and evaluation...

## Why JuPylates

- integrates in the users's environment (for Jupyter-based courses)
- easy to deploy (at least for training purposes)
- easy to extend
  writing an exercise is (almost) no harder than writing a Jupyter notebook
- harness the full power of Jupyter and the underlying open source scientific computing ecosystem
    - rich authoring, computational (and visualization?) tools
    - multilanguage
- lean (1k lines of code), modular, interoperable
- flexible learning record managment: can e.g. be used purely locally
