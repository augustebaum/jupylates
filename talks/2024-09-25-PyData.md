## Résumé

Jupyter based environments are getting a lot of traction for teaching
computing, programming, and data sciences. The narrative structure of
notebooks has indeed proven its value for guiding each student at
their own pace to the discovery and understanding of new concepts or
new idioms (e.g. how do I extract a column in pandas?). But then these
new pieces of knowledge tend to quickly fade out and be
forgotten. Indeed long term acquisition of knowledge and skills takes
reinforcement by repetition. This is the foundation of many online
learning platforms like Webwork or WIMS that offer exercises with
randomization and automatic feedback. And of popular "AI-powered" apps
-- e.g. to learn foreign languages -- that use spaced repetition
algorithms designed by educational and neuro sciences to deliver just
the right amount of repetition.

What if you could author such exercizes as notebooks, to benefit from
everything that Jupyter can offer (think rich narratives,
computations, visualization, interactions)? What if you could
integrate such exercises right into your Jupyter based course? What if
a learner could get personalized exercise recommandations based on
their past learning records, without having to give away these
sensitive pieces of information away?

That's Jupylates (work in progress). And thanks to the open source
scientific stack, it's just a small Jupyter extension.

In this talk, we will first briefly review our usage of Jupyter for
teaching at Université Paris-Saclay, to motivate how we came to
develop Jupylates. Then, after a quick demo, we will discuss its
design, describe its current and upcoming features, and report on its
usage in two large freshmen classes in 2023-2024.

Time permitting, we will zoom out and deliver a brief tour of our
Jupyter course infrastructure, advertising in particular Travo for
GitLab-based nbgrader-compatible assignment management.

## Jupylates at a glance

### Context

:::{admonition} Using Jupyter at Paris-Saclay since 2017 

- for teaching at scale computation and data (and programming)
- great for telling stories
- with fine grained scenarization of interactive activities: read,
  try, apply, get immediate feedback, pause, experiment, explore,
  take notes, etc.

:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{hint} Success

- engages students to explore the material at their own pace
- effective to take them by the hand to discover new concepts or idioms

:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{error} Failure
- as quickly as they discover, they forget
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} No surprise
- long term acquisition takes some amount of repetition
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} Question

Could we do that within Jupyter?

### Jupylates demo

- Pandas exercise
- A C++ exercise
- Markdown sources of an exercise
- Memory effect
- Recommendation

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### What have we seen

1.  Train on randomised exercises  
    authored as (text) notebooks with lightweight annotation
2.  Browse exercises and/or get recommendations  
    thanks to recording and exploiting learning analytics
3.  Jupyter $\longrightarrow$ language/library agnostic
4.  Tight integration right in the course

### Adaptative learning and AI-based recommenders

### Use cases for Jupylates?

When your student use Jupyter anyway
- Tight integration in your course
  - Green lights and remediation (WIP)
  - self-test
  - Drilling for a skill
  - Exams (WIP)
- No external platform, no licence
- Control on their personal data

When you need bespoke exercises
- If you know how to write a notebook, you know how to write an exercise
- Anything you can do in Jupyter, you can do in Jupylates (WIP)  
  your favorite, language, library, visualization, widgets,

When you are part of a community


The tension between:

Tension linear scenario / adaptation

Long term memorization

Limitations


Tension story vs reusability


## Jupylates decomposed


## Thesis

- Local learning analytics




## Vision and future plans

### Collaboration with Alea

http://alea.education/

### Exerciser

- Refining the execution model
- Javascript reimplementation:
    - full notebook: widgets, MyST, ...
	- integrated in any notebook (currently Python only)
- Explore ways to foster exercise sharing
    - collaboration with Codex

### Activity browser


### Learning analytics

Alternative: group by «integration with other Jupyter activities» /
«interaction with instructors and researchers»


- Record learning analytics from other Jupyter activities
  - read that course unit
  - tried/failed/succeded that nbgrader exercise
  - flashcards (e.g. jupyter-cards)

- Record random seeds and answers for reproducibility of past attempts

- Record feedback from the user and consent (or not) to share

- Share learning analytics:
  - dashboards for instructors
  - data to train recommenders
  - data for researchers

### Recommendation

- Better recommendations
- Recommend other activities than Jupylates

### Research

Example research question:
- Evaluate the effectiveness of spaced repetition
- Evaluate the recommenation strategies
- Evaluate the added value of using other's learning analytics for recommendation
- Evaluate the added value of semantic annotations of learning objects

  issues


A focus: they will sniff the stuff anyway; let's deal them good one

- personal data protection
- fair access to ressources
- tight integration in the work environment
- contextualisation to their courses
- transparent about the environmental impact
